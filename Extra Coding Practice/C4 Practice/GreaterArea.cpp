/****************************************************************************************************************
Areas of Rectangles
The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width. Write a program that
asks for the length and width of two rectangles. The program should tell the user which
rectangle has the greater area, or if the areas are the same.

MODIFICATION: This is currently modified to use functions. Feel free to add/take away functions as needed. 
However, I encourage you to use functions in some form or fashion that way you are ensuring you understand
both functions and selction statements!
