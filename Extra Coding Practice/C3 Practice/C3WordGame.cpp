Write a program that plays a word game with the user. The program should ask the
user to enter the following:
	His or her name
	His or her age
	The name of a city
	The name of a college
	A profession

AGE , NAME went to college at COLLEGE . NAME graduated and went to work
as a PROFESSION . Then, NAME adopted a(n) ANIMAL named PETNAME . They
both lived happily ever after!

if you would like it double checked. Just email me the .cpp file!
