1. [Check out this website!](https://www.mathwarehouse.com/programming/passing-by-value-vs-by-reference-visual-explanation.php) This has a neat graphic visual.
2. Look at some of the responses [on this forum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419/whats-the-difference-between-passing-by-reference-vs-passing-by-value) to see different explanations. If one response doesn't make sense, look at a different response!
