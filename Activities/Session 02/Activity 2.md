# Activity Title: Converting Pseudo-code
###### Below are some bits of Pseudo-code. Use the given note cards to assemble a three dimensional flowchart from each bit of psuedo-code. Start with the first one and see if you can do more. You can do this at home by drawing a flowchart for each bit of psuedo code.

### Problem 1
```
Begin
  input hours
  input rate
  pay = hours * rate
  print pay
End 
```
### Problem 2
```
Begin
  input x, y
  sum = x + y
  print sum
End 
```
### Probelm 3
```
Begin
  input hours, rate
  if hours ≤ 40 then
    pay = hours * rate
  else
    pay = 40 * rate + (hours – 40) * rate * 1.5
    print pay
End 
```
### Problem 4
```
Begin
  print “Input 3 numbers: ”
  input a, b, c
  avg = average(a, b, c)
  print “Average is ”, avg
End 

Begin Average(a, b, c)
  sum = a + b + c
  avg = sum / 3.0
  return avg
End 
```
