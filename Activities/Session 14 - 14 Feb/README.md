# Session Re-cap
Here is what we did today: 
- We worked on key vocabulary terms by testing nomenclature you should be familiar with. I converted the slide show to a powerpoint so you can look through that on here and quiz yourself!
- We broke up sample code in a google doc by highlighting various parts of it
