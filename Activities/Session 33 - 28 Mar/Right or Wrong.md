# Right or Wrong
Take a look at the following facts created by students in the last session. Which ones of these are __false__?

1. A while loop is good for determining if an entered grade is pass/fail.
   For example:
   ```
   while (grade >= 60 || grade <= 100) 
   {
      cout << "You pass!";
      cout << "\nPlease enter another grade."
      cin >> grade;
   }
   ```
2. A for loop is good for averaging test scores for a class.
3. A do-while loop is bad for menu driven programs.
