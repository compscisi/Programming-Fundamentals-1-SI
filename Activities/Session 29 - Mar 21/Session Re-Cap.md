# Session Re - Cap
Today was primarily kinesthetic (meaning we did a lot of discussion and in person work rather than computer work). Below are the main points we hit on that you can do in your free time:

1. Think about proper exam resources - try to have some websites/notes/stuff that you can access quickly for use on your exam and/or homework
2. Know about our Wiki - near the top of the screen, you will see a tab labelled "Wiki" with a little book icon. This is a student made cheat sheet that you are welcome to use or contribute to. I encourage you to become familiar with this so that you can use it!
3. Make sure you can answer questions - go through and try to answer the questions in the back of each chapter in the text book. This should put you in a good place.
