# Update
Hey guys! I know I haven't been updating the GitHub as often as I normally do, I apologize. This is really because a lot of the stuff we're doing is kinesthetic. If you are desperate for study resources, send me an email at shelby.king593@my.tccd.edu and let me know where you need help - i'll see what I can do!
