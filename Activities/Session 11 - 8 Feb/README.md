# Session Re-cap
We focused on review from Chapter 3. Here is what we did:
- We began editting the wiki for this repository to create a cheat sheet, feel free to update that with important information. You will need collaborator access from me, which I will very happily get that for you.
- We worked on questions from the powerpoint uploaded. This is a great study resource for home as you can quiz yourself! Please use this! __This is the Capture the Flag power point.__
