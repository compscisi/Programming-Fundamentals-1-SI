# Session Re-Cap
Here are the main points of what we did today:

1. We watched [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz2XNQAIFpM) on implementation of relational operators
2. We filled out a graphic organizer (labelled "WS" on here!) on relational operators
3. We quized ourselves using both of the attached powerpoints (these should be fairly easy)

If you can answer these confidently, you will be starting out strong!
