### Topics We are Focusing On:
- [Local and Global Variables](https://www.codesdope.com/cpp-scope-of-variables/)
- [Overloading Functions](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/function-overloading)

### Other Topics to be Familiar With
*Note: These are all sections in your textbook. I picked these out because it is good to see the material explained in a different way AND these are generally shorter! (-;*
- [Defining/Calling Functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_functions.htm)
- [Prototpying Functions](https://codescracker.com/cpp/cpp-function-definition.htm)
