###### Whaddup! You have navigated your way to one of the prime spots for this activity. Below are some helpful resources for *you, the programming student!*

### Helpful Resources
###### Click around here and get familiar with some web resources.
- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/) is a __reference tool__, kind of like a wiki for C++ commands. There are also various tutorials and other information on here.
- [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) is another great __reference tool__.
- [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/c-cpp-language-and-standard-libraries?view=vs-2017) is another awesome __reference tool__. 
- [Pearson](http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_gaddis_sowcpp_cs_8/244/62625/16032053.cw/index.html) has some resources that are meant to be used with your textbook!
- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a neat __tutorial__ tool to get extra practice with C++, or to pick up new coding langages. This is free to use and has a mobile app.
- [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm) has a bunch of __tutorials__ on stuff we cover in class as well as general C++ tips.
- [Google](https://developers.google.com/edu/c++/) also has some helpful __tutorials__ for C++.

### Suggestions for Programming Fundamentals I
###### Here are some suggestions to help you get set up and remain successful.
1. __Download Visual Studio through your Imagine account!!!__ If you haven't already, you should download Visual Studio on your home computer. It is best to download this using your Imagine account, as it is superior to the community edition. A handout on this may be found in "Helpful Guides".
2. __Save files on your Google Drive.__ Use your Google Drive to save files from class rather than a USB. USB's are easy to lose, whereas a Google Drive can be accessed from anywhere. Take it from me as someone who lost their USB halfway into last semester. )-:
3. __Don't be shy with comments on programs.__ As a programmer, it is extremely rare that you will ever be penalized for commenting *too much.* Especially as you work class examples - try to comment what is going on with the code.
4. __Exchange contact info with a classmate.__ It's always good to have a friend to rely on. Perhaps you will be able to study as a group or simply catch the other up on a missed lecture or two.
5. __Come to SI!__ Remember that SI is group study! Group study is most effective when done reguarlarly. Attending once a week may be more beneficial than you think.

### Supplemental Instruction Dos and Don'ts
- __DO__ come to SI sessions prepared with notes.
- __DON'T__ come to SI expecting another lecture.
- __DO__ contact SI Leader via email (shelby.king593@my.tccd.edu)
- __DON'T__ request class notes from SI Leader. I am not allowed to give students notes. You wouldn't want my notes anyway - they're taken specifically for session ideas!
- __DO__ try to attend sessions reguarly. Whether it's once a week or once every two weeks, this is meant to help you guys understand programming!
